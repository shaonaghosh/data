Contains links to the datasets that can be experimented with the meanfield, SSLGraphLabelling and 0TemperatureIsing methods. Also contains example scripts (for some datasets) to generate graphs and trees from these datasets - randomly sampled graph, graph with minimum spanning tree edges and random spanning tree edges for noise. Also, available are the resultant graphs for some of the datasets.
